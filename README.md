## Whole system
If you're running kde plasma then, go to setting, Appearance, Font Management and search for "Mukti Narrow". You can either disable it or delete it.

You can also do it manually from `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/`. 
But then you may need to reinstall it from any other source. 
Or, [from here](https://www.wfonts.com/font/mukti-narrow).
