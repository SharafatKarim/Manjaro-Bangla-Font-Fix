# Manjaro-Bangla-Font-Fix
Simple script to fix Bangla font issue (especially `telegram`) in Manjaro and Arch Linux based operating systems.

Simply run the following one line command to install the script!
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SharafatKarim/Manjaro-Bangla-Font-Fix/main/main.sh | bash
```
if this script doesn't work, you can always revert back to previous self by,
```
sudo rm -rf "/etc/fonts/conf.d/76-bangla.conf"
```

# Another way
If you're running kde-plasma, you can list all your system fonts that uses a specific language! And you get the idea, just delete those (backup recommended). Hope, it works!
